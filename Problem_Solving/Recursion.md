# Recursion

## Introduction

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It is a powerful tool for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.

## Key Concepts

- **Base Case**: The condition that stops the recursion and provides the terminating condition for the recursive calls.
  
- **Recursive Case**: The condition that defines the recursive step, where the function calls itself with modified inputs to progress towards the base case.

## Advantages of Recursion

- **Simplicity**: Recursion can often lead to elegant and concise solutions, especially for problems with recursive structures.

- **Divide and Conquer**: Recursion naturally divides a problem into smaller subproblems, making it suitable for divide-and-conquer strategies.

- **Readability**: Recursion can make code more readable and easier to understand, especially for problems that are naturally recursive in nature.

## Common Interview Questions

### 1. Factorial

**Description:**
Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer n.

**Solution:**
- Recursive Approach

### 2. Fibonacci Sequence

**Description:**
Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.

**Solution:**
- Recursive Approach

### 3. Tower of Hanoi

**Description:**
Move a tower of disks from one peg to another, following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

**Solution:**
- Recursive Approach

## Best Practices

- **Define Base Case**: Ensure that the recursive function has a base case to prevent infinite recursion.
  
- **Optimize Recursion**: Consider memoization or dynamic programming to optimize recursive solutions and avoid redundant computations.

- **Watch for Stack Overflow**: Be mindful of potential stack overflow errors, especially for problems with deep recursion or limited stack space.

## Conclusion

Recursion is a fundamental programming technique that can be used to solve a wide range of problems efficiently. By understanding the key concepts of recursion, practicing with common recursion problems, and following best practices, software engineers can enhance their problem-solving skills and excel in technical interviews.
