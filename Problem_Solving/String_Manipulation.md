# String Manipulation

## Introduction

String manipulation involves performing various operations on strings, such as concatenation, substring extraction, searching, and sorting. It is a fundamental skill in software development and is frequently tested in technical interviews.

## Common String Operations

- **Concatenation**: Joining two or more strings together to form a single string.
  
- **Substring**: Extracting a portion of a string based on specified indices or lengths.
  
- **Searching**: Finding the occurrence or position of a substring within a larger string.
  
- **Sorting**: Arranging characters or substrings within a string in a specific order.

## Common Interview Questions

### 1. Reverse a String

**Description:**
Reverse a given string.

**Solution:**
- Iterative Approach
- Recursive Approach

### 2. Anagram Detection

**Description:**
Determine if two strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters in a different order).

**Solution:**
- Sorting Approach
- Frequency Count Approach

### 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

**Description:**
Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.

**Solution:**
- Sliding Window Approach

## Best Practices

- **Efficient Data Structures**: Use appropriate data structures (such as arrays, sets, or maps) to optimize string manipulation operations.
  
- **Handle Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases such as empty strings, null inputs, or strings with special characters when implementing string manipulation algorithms.
  
- **Optimize Algorithms**: Analyze time and space complexities of algorithms to ensure efficiency, especially for large input sizes.
