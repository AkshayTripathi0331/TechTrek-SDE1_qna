# Arrays

## Introduction

Arrays are fundamental data structures in computer science and programming. An array is a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key. They are used to store multiple values of the same type in a contiguous block of memory.

## Operations

Arrays support various operations, including:

- Accessing elements: Retrieving the value of an element at a specific index.
- Inserting elements: Adding elements at the beginning, end, or a specific position in the array.
- Deleting elements: Removing elements from the array, either by index or value.
- Updating elements: Modifying the value of an existing element at a specific index.

## Common Interview Questions

### 1. Array Rotation

**Description:**
Rotate an array to the left or right by a given number of positions.

**Example:**
Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, Rotation: 2
Output: `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`

**Solution:**
- Brute Force Approach
- Reversal Algorithm

### 2. Two Sum

**Description:**
Find two numbers in an array that sum up to a specific target value.

**Example:**
Input: `[2, 7, 11, 15]`, Target: 9
Output: `[0, 1]` (Indices of elements 2 and 7)

**Solution:**
- Brute Force
- Hash Table

### 3. Maximum Subarray Sum

**Description:**
Find the contiguous subarray within an array that has the largest sum.

**Example:**
Input: `[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`
Output: `6` (Subarray `[4, -1, 2, 1]` has the largest sum)

**Solution:**
- Kadane's Algorithm
- Dynamic Programming
