## Question 3
**Rice Spent in Hostel**: A certain quantity of rice is spent daily for 30 students in a hostel. One day some students were absent, as a result, the quantity of rice has been spent in the ratio of 6:5. How many students were present on that day?

## Answer 3
Given that the total number of students is 30, let's assume the absent students are represented by x. So, the present students would be 30 - x. According to the ratio:
30 / (30 - x) = 6 / 5
Solving this equation, we find x = 5 and 30 - x = 25. Therefore, 25 students were present on that day.
